# My World – Interactive Terrain Editor (CSFML)

This project was developed in 2025 as part of my studies at Epitech Paris (Discovery of Software Engineering).  
**Grade: B**

**My World** is a tile-based terraforming simulator inspired by terrain editors like Tycoon Terrain (Unity3D).  
It features an isometric map projection, mouse interactions, real-time editing tools, and a custom UI — built using C and CSFML.

## Features

### Core (Mandatory)
- Interactive window that handles mouse & keyboard events
- Frame rate–independent animations
- 3D projection (isometric)
- Texture-mapped tiles
- Tile selection with the mouse
- Toolbar with at least 3 effects:
  - Raise/lower tile altitude
  - Reset all altitudes
  - Adjust size of area of effect

### UX Enhancements
- Buttons with visual states: idle, hover, click
- Editable fields to set map size
- Help tooltips on hover
- Additional layers (e.g. lava, water)
- Arrow keys to move camera view
- Zoom in/out via scroll or keys

### Optional Features
- Save/load map at runtime (`.legend` file format)
- Animated layers
- Sound effects for user actions
- Slope-based texture switching
- Add buildings or roads that follow terrain shape

## Controls
- Mouse: select tiles, interact with UI
- Arrow keys: navigate across map
- Scroll / +/-: zoom in/out
